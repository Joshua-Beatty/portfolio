# TypeScript-Template

This is a simple typescript template that uses esbuild and includes a logger

## Build

To build run `npm run build`

## Development

Run `npm run dev` to start nodemon watching the src folder for typescript changes to immediately build and run.

## Production

To run the app run `npm start` in production I would recommend running the app with [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
